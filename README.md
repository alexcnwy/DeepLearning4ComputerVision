The notebook covers how to:
* Use a pre-trained model (VGG16) to predict imagenet classes for new images
* How to fine-tune a pre-trained model on another dataset to predict new clases
* How to get CNN activations to use as numerical representations of images
* Using numerical representations of images to find similar images for an input image
* Do PCA on the numerical representations

## Getting Started

cd to the directory and run
```
jupyter notebook
```

### Prerequisites

```
